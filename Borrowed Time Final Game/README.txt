Borrowed Time is a top down dungeon crawler where you play as a character who unknowingly sacrifices his wife to the Devil for time powers. Using these time powers you must slow down time to get past obstacles as you slash your way through enemies to rescue your wife. But be careful, your time powers attract the attention of time ghosts who will hunt you down as you use your powers!

Known bugs:
1) The time bomb is dependent on your FPS. Meaning that it will throw more slowly if you are not getting 60 FPS. Because of how it was coded we could not simpy use Time.deltaTime to remedy. This does not break the game but if it is throwing weirdly slow then this is why.

2) This isn't as much of a bug but if you get hit by a spinning blade, but then immediately walk out of the collision zone and then back into it, you will get hit again. We considered making you invulnerable after you get hit or adding a debounce but this was going to cause issues when we had multiple obstacles or enemies stacked together.

Controls:
WASD to move
Left click to attack
Time bomb (explained in game but here it is anyway) hold right click to charge and fire, left click to cancel
E to talk to NPCs or open chests (explained in game)

Other:
Chests were never fully implemented, they were going to be used for upgrades but we ended up scrapping the upgrades feature so now they are just a way of scoring how well the player did though it is not a good representation. Do not be confused as to what you should do with them.. as there is nothing to do with them.
